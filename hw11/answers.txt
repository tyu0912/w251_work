1. What parameters did you change? 

2. What values did you try? 

Change 1:
- Adam was replaced with Adamax. Adamax is supposed to work better with sparse parameter updates. The gradient term is essentially ignored when itâ€™s small therefore parameters are less susceptible to gradient noise.



3. Did you try any other changes that made things better or worse? Did they improve or degrade the model? 

4. Based on what you observed, what conclusions can you draw about the different parameters and their values?
