### HW12 Notes:

- Process to set up parallel system was run successfully
- The Crawler script did not run as expected for me. Many links failed to scrape due to connection and/or empty file issues
- Will work to try and fix the above

Potential Improvements:
- Abstraction of lazynlp files
- crawler script potentially use a multiprocessing libraries instead of bash?
- Some type of error handling
