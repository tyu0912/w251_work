Part 1:1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?⁃ I did 178 images2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?⁃ 175 Tie Fighters⁃ 137 Millenium Falcons3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?⁃ Use some type of unsupervised learning technique like k-means⁃ Just augment what I current have4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?⁃ It would improve the richness and diversity. Must of the images are just different angles and sizes. Part 2:1. Describe the following augmentations in your own words:• Flip - Mirroring an image along an axis.• Rotation - Spinning the image around a particular point on the image.• Scale - Make image smaller or bigger• Crop - Cut parts of the image• Translation - Move the along the different axes• Noise - Random variation in the brightness and color information.Part 3:1. Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?- Time of sound segment (initial and final)- Sound quality metrics: Intensity (decibels), Frequencies (pitch),
