1. Describe your solution in detail. What neural network did you use? What dataset was it trained on? What accuracy does it achieve?

2. Does it achieve reasonable accuracy in your empirical tests? Would you use this solution to develop a robust, production-grade system?

3. What framerate does this method achieve on the Jetson? Where is the bottleneck?

4. Which is a better quality detector: the OpenCV or yours?
