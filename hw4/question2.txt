Q1: Name all the layers in the network, make sure you understand what they do.

- Input: What's going in
- Conv: A sort of compression layer that transforms an image based on filter size
- Relu: An activation layer
- Pool: Usually max or average. A sort of summary layer that condenses layers based of a striding filter. 

Experiment with the number and size of filters in each layer. Does it improve the accuracy?

- Mostly yes. Making the conv filters 16 and 64 from 8 and 16  reduced the accuracy to 0.90-0.95 from 0.93-0.98

Remove the pooling layers. Does it impact the accuracy?

- The accuracy hovers around 0.9-0.99 but it is not very stable and takes longer to reach somewhat of a plateau

Add one more conv layer. Does it help with accuracy?

- layer_defs.push({type:'conv', sx:5, filters:8, stride:1, pad:2, activation:'relu'});
- The above line was added after the second pooling. The validation accuracy seems to hover around 0.92 - 0.96
- Not too much difference from prior observations.

Increase the batch size. What impact does it have?

- The impact seems to be in line with what is seen before. It hovers around 0.92-0.97

What is the best accuracy you can achieve? Are you over 99%? 99.5%?

- It occasionally hits 99% but unable to across 99.5%
